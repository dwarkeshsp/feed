                <p>If technological progress has slowed down, what is causing it? Here is a hypothesis.
Broadly speaking, there are three domains of activity important to technological progress: science, invention, and business. Science discovers new knowledge; invention creates useful machines, chemicals, processes, or other products; and business produces and distributes these products in a scalable, self-sustaining way. (Occasionally inventions are distributed by government: water sanitation is an example. But this oversim…</p>

Only one of those is true.

General Remarks

E.g., 41% of babies are born to unwed mothers. Q: Why did this happen? It looks like we don’t really know. You might think it’s because the “incentives” to marry have declined – there is less stigma &#8230; Continue reading Marriage &#038; Testosterone Levels</p>

                <p>To fully understand progress, we must contrast it with non-progress. Of particular interest are the technologies that have failed to live up to the promise they seemed to have decades ago. And few technologies have failed more to live up to a greater promise than nuclear power.
In the 1950s, nuclear was the energy of the future. Two generations later, it provides only about 10% of world electricity, and reactor design hasn‘t fundamentally changed in decades. (Even “advanced reactor designs” are based on con…</p>

People should not be trusted with writing their own legacy. Certainly, not after they’ve aged into has-beens reminiscing on the glories of their youth. [1]
Jordan Mechner’s The Making of Prince of Persia avoids this trap by being written in real time. It is not a polished accounting, but merely his diary from the time he spent working on Prince of Persia, starting with his college graduation, and concluding 4 years later.
It’s also flat out the best biography I’ve ever…</p>

                <p>I’ve started writing a book about the accomplishments of industrial civilization, the major discoveries and inventions behind them, and the meaning of it all. I’m hosting a 13-month series of discussion salons through Interintellect based on it.

The book is very much a work in progress—won’t be out for a couple of years. But we’ll go through the outline chapter by chapter. Each month I’ll present the material I have so far and the open questions I’m still researching, and we’ll discuss.

                <p>Update (April 5, 2021): So it turns out that Adam Chalcraft and Michael Greene already proved the essential result of this post back in 1994 (hat tip to commenter Dylan).
