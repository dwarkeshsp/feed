                <p>My anonymous friend at the University of Texas has issues with yesterday&#8217;s post.  Here&#8217;s his critique.  Enjoy! I respectfully disagree with Bryan&#8217;s recent post on anti-Communism and &#8220;anti-racism.&#8221;  I believe he falls into a classic false equivalence trap; just because two things sound similar does not make them fundamentally similar.  For example, slicing someone&#8217;s stomach [&#8230;]

                <p>In a previous post in the Fund People, not Projects series I talked about a potential new structure for a hypothetical funding agency. That was just one proposal among many one could make. This post has a set of other such proposals, along with a brief justification for why it might be a good idea. The proposals are not fully fleshed out but they are meant to be inspirational, and intended to be more broadly in the right direction than precisely ready for implementation.

                <p>Is progress slowing down? In a previous post I explained why I got convinced that it is. Some people making this argument point to quantitative evidence, such as GDP or total factor productivity. I gave more qualitative evidence, or perhaps very crude quantitative evidence, by counting technological breakthroughs/revolutions: five in the Second Industrial Revolution, versus only one so far in the Third.
But this approach has its own difficulties:
It is sensitive to the granularity of technological revolutio…</p>

But how stupid is the conventional fine art world? Fairly stupid:

The drab free port zone near the Geneva city center, a compound of blocky gray and vanilla warehouses surrounded by train tracks, roads and a barbed-wire fence, looks like the kind of place where beauty goes to die.

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>In his latest post, Scott writes on the success of radical top-down reforms, contrary to his previous writing on the dangers of radical top-down reforms.
This leads to confusion when he approaches the Acemoglu et al. paper The Consequences of Radical Reform:

I think my real concern here is that someone might use this paper to support some sort of far-left reform, saying “come on, this shows that reforms work better than leaving institutions in place”, when an alternate lesson is “capitalism works better th…</p>

              <div class="details-content">
                <p>Back in 2015-2016 I wrote a series of posts criticizing the book &quot;The Entrepreneurial State&quot; by Mariana Mazzucato. While I'm not going to add much new to what I wrote back then, here I wanted to clarify what the critique amounts to in a concise way, providing a guide for all those posts. The earlier posts of the series are in Spanish and you can find them linked there but in what follows I'll just link to the English ones.
First, read this to understand the context in which the book appeared. One …</p>

Here’s a chart of GiveWell’s annual money moved. It rose dramatically from 2014 to 2015, then more or less plateaued:

Open Philanthropy doesn’t provide an equivalent chart, but they do have a grants database, so I was able to compile the data myself. It peaks in 2017, then falls a bit and plateaus:

                <p>What follows are some thoughts on the question &quot;what is aging&quot;. Initially there is a meandering back and forth around the concept using a non-biological example (pyramids), later we get to a more concrete definition of aging, and using that to cast some light on various questions like whether aging is a disease or not.

                <p>When I wrote my post on technological stagnation, the top question I got asked was: So, how do we fix it?
I don’t have the definitive answer, but here’s a starting point. I generally think about the causes of progress on three levels:
Funding. How do research, development, and distribution get funded? This encompasses both for-profit investing and non-profit funding of R&amp;D.
Government. How does the law enable progress, or hamper it? Progress depends on good legal institutions; equally, it can be stifled…</p>

                <p>In the US, federal R&amp;D expenditures are down since their peak in 1964 at 1.86% of GDP. Now they are 0.61% of GDP. This from ITIF is representative of this narrative:

Or here's Gruber and Johnson,
“From 1940 to 1964, federal funding for research and development increased twentyfold. At its peak in the mid-1960s, this spending amount was around 2 percent of annual gross domestic product—roughly one in every fifty dollars in the United States was devoted to government funding of research and development (…</p>

If I were to rewrite it now I would note that trends in batteries and solar panels have continued, and I would add some new trends like for single cell sequencing (A whole new category that didn't exist until 2009).

                <p>One of the hottest topics right now in the world of meta-science is using lotteries to fund research. In a nutshell, the rationale is that it's hard to tell who or what will be successful, and it is very costly to try to do so as well. A system that relies on peer review demands of researchers time to write grants and to review them. I have reviewed before the effectiveness of peer review at figuring out &quot;what's good&quot; in the context of grant awards, finding that peer review as currently practiced …</p>

Lucio Russo, The Forgotten Revolution: How Science Was Born in 300 BC and Why it Had to Be Reborn
Russo argues that Hellenistic science was significantly more developed than generally believed, and that it was killed by the Romans. This is one of those books that you have to approach with aggressive skepticism: Russo makes the case for a Hellenistic hypothetico-deductive scientific method, and some of the deductions he makes from second-hand readings certainly seem a bit much.

                <p>Though I'm right now not employed as a software engineer I have been writing code under various hats for the last few years (As a data scientist, ML engineer, and software engineer). Naturally me being me I have not just done the thing but also reflected about the thing. Questions like what's good software, what does being a good software engineer mean, how should meetings be ran, and so on. Here are some thoughts on that.

Forecasting
Arpit Gupta on prediction markets vs 538 in the 2020 election: &quot;Betting markets are pretty well calibrated—state markets that have an estimate of 50% are, in fact, tossups in the election. 538 is at least 20 points off—if 538 says that a state has a ~74% chance of going for Democrats, it really is a tossup.&quot; Also, In Defense of Polling: How I earned $50,000 on election night using polling data and some Python code.

It is often frustrating for someone needing empathy to have us assume that they want reassurance or “fix-it” advice.

                <p>One of the points that Braben makes in Scientific Freedom, and one that others have made elsewhere, is that science is not as welcoming of new ideas as it may seem. The process of peer review stands in the way of new breakthroughs, and one man's crankery is another's brilliant insight, or so goes the story.
The examples of this that probably come to mind are old: Galileo and heliocentrism or perhaps Semmelweis and hand washing and in general the germ theory of disease. So one may think that science used to …</p>

Now we have in our hands a new last 19th-century Russian novel—perhaps even the final one. And while Nabokov selected the obvious and trivial task of combining the Russian and American novels, our &quot;Dostoyevsky&quot; (an obvious pseudonym) has given himself the unparalleled and interminably heroic mission of combining the Russian novel with the Mexican soap opera.

Philosophy
In the 20th century, philosophy of science attracted first-rate minds: scientists like Henri Poincaré, Pierre Duhem, and Michael Polanyi, as well as philosophers like Popper, Quine, Carnap, Kuhn, and Lakatos. Today the field is a backwater, lost in endless debates about scientific realism which evoke the malaise of medieval angelology.1 D…</p>

Starting in August 2019, each round consisted of one week of surveys followed by two weeks of market trading. I finish…</p>
